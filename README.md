HELLO!
Welcome to my RESTaurant site. Here are a few tips on how to navigate your way through this app.
------------------------------
- At the top of each page, there is a HOME button to make it easy for you to navigate back to the beginning any time you want.

- A GUEST LIST is provided to show which parties are waiting along with the number of people they are with. If a new party would like to be added, they can 'Make a reservation' and add themselves to the list.

- At the HOME page, RESTaurant's MENU is listed. You are able to 'Add to this menu' by clicking on the link. Don't worry about the same thing being added twice. This program is made to detect and make sure that each food item is only listed once.

- By clicking on each food item on the MENU, you can see which parties have ordered that dish. The program gives you the ability to 'fix this dish' or 'remove this dish' if it isn't to your liking.

- On the PARTIES page, you can click on a specific party and check out what they ordered. There is a radio button placed to add orders. Next to order items, there is an 'X' box which deltes that item or a 'don't like this' button which keeps the item on the list but charges $0 on the bill.

- A party can 'change reservation' if they want to change the name of # of guests. Cancelling a reservation is an option as well.

- From a specific party's page ('party/party_id') you can 'CHECKOUT' which leads to their receipt. Tip suggestions are listed below are easy calculation. Once they have 'PAID' you are lead back to the HOME page. That party is still kept in the databse but removed from the WAIT LIST. There is also an option to print the receipt below the 'PAY' button.
